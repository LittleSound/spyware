# Undou draft

Trying to build a tool that can track and patch state change history. Used for scenarios similar to undo/redo functionality. The current implementation is based on [immer](https://github.com/immerjs/immer).

It's just a draft for now. If you want to play around, you can clone it and run `nr dev`.

If you donâ€™t know how to use it, you can take a look at the [unit tests](./test/undou.test.ts).
