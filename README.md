# spyware draft

Trying to build a tool that can track and patch state change history. Used for scenarios similar to undo/redo functionality. The current implementation is based on [immer](https://github.com/immerjs/immer).

It's just a draft for now. If you want to play around, you can clone it and run `nr dev`.
